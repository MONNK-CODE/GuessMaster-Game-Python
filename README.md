# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

The Number Guessing Game is a simple command-line Python application where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether a guess is too high or too low, guiding the user to the correct answer.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation:** The game starts by generating a random secret number between 1 and 100.
- **User Input Validation:** Ensures that the user enters a valid integer. If the input is not a valid number, the game prompts the user to enter a valid number.
- **Guess Counter:** Tracks the number of attempts taken by the user to guess the number correctly.
- **Performance Feedback:** Provides feedback on the user's performance based on the number of attempts.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Run the script in a Python environment.
2. **Enter Your Guesses:** Input your guess of the secret number when prompted.
3. **Use the Feedback:** Adjust your guesses based on the game's feedback until you guess the number correctly.
4. **End of Game:** The game concludes with a congratulatory message and tells you how many attempts it took. Based on the number of tries, it will also comment on your guessing speed.
